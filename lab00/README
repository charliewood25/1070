The step-by-step instructions for the lab are below.

For some problems, you'll be entering Python code 
into the Python interpreter.  Recall that you start
the interpreter from the command line as follows:

$ python
...
>>>


For some problems, you'll be reading the programs I've
provided in this directory, running them, and making 
changes.  You'll want to open these files and modify
them using your favorite text editor (vi, emacs, nano,
or whatever you've chosen).

To run a program that's saved in a file "foo.py",
you enter this at the command line:

$ python foo.py
