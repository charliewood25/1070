Gephi Lab

Gephi is a program for visualizing graphs.  It also includes 
implementations of some of the graph algorithms we've discussed
in class, like PageRank and the HITS (hub/authority) algorithm
for discovering the most "important" nodes in a directed graph.

In this lab we'll use it to create some visualizations of
social networks. It used to be relatively easy to download
a graph of your Facebook friends and all friendships between
them, but this is now much trickier.  So instead, I've
produced a few social graphs from Twitter that you'll
find in this directory.

br.gdf: Vertices are Twitter users with > 15 tweets in Breton
gd.gdf: Vertices are Twitter users with > 50 tweets in Scottish Gaelic
gv.gdf: Vertices are Twitter users with > 5 tweets in Manx Gaelic
ha.gdf: Vertices are Twitter users with > 100 tweets in Hausa
ht.gdf: Vertices are Twitter users with > 2000 tweets in Haitian Creole

In each case, there is a directed edge from one user to another when
the first mentions the second in a tweet.
